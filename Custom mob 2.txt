Impulse command
execute @a ~ ~ ~ entitydata @r[type=sheep,rm=16,r=100] {CustomName:"spawn_leach"}
The sheep represents the mob we will be ransforming into our custom mob. It could be any entity

Next we run a repeating command running into a chain command. The repeating command needs redstone and the chain command is always active.
No conditional command

Repeating:
execute @e[type=sheep,name=spawn_leach] ~ ~ ~ /summon

The /summon just shows taht you can run a summon comamnd to summon your mob. To craete one, use MCStacker

Chain:
/tp @e[type=sheep,name=spawn_leach] ~ -10 ~

Now we send the sheep to the void so it dies and it's loot wont appear
